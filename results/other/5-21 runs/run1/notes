Notes: 

-Sell price is currentprice - 2*std.
-Buy price is currentprice + 0.10

-Notes on bad buys:
	-Buying at top of hill price. Need to engage sooner.
		-We end up buying right before huge downswings (which come after huge upswings.)
	-Or buys when there is an unreasonably large most recent jump

-Could hold out longer on some trades 
	-EX: would double profit on first SHW trade if waited 1 more minute.

-Possible Improvements
	1. Buy once we clear transaction cost. Might reduce profit on some trades, but also could eliminate loss on others. Might come out net positive from this exchange. Also change cdf criteria to 3 cents instead of 10, since our transcost is 3 cents per share
	2. Don't buy above a max 2nd or 1st derivative. These could be signalers for incoming downturns
	3. Make holding time longer?
		-Missed some profitable trades by about 3 minutes
	4. Autocorrelation test might help filter out bad trades since it will eliminate especially noisy candidates


-Next run:
	-Implement improvement 1
