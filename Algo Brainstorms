Algo Brainstorms


-Could use FFT to figure out how long to wait before ditching a particular strategy/purchase. We can do this by identifying a strong driving cycle and then only waiting for the duration of one of its cycles.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0. At each step, generate a list of price jumps from the closing prices.
1. Generate a PDF of this list by doing a monte carlo fit for a set of normal distributions.
2. Generate the CDF of this pdf for some value that you need the price to be in order to turn a profit.
3. (1-that) is the probability that the price will jump up by the amount you gave to the cdf.
4. If the probability is sufficiently high, then buy according to some weighting factor
5. Once the price is reached, sell. If we get to the buy price again, then sell.

Idea:

0. Fit a distribution to recent stock prices
1. Find which ones have a > 60% chance of going up
2. Find which of these have a strong 5, 10, 15 minute fourier component
3. Find which of these are upward momentum
4. Combine these three signals in some way so that we buy the highest one
	-Buy an amount that is somehow determined by the algo parameters
5. Decide a sell or a give up price
6. Sell at sell or give up price
	-Or sell when momentum has a sustained downturn


To Do:

-Play with percent chance of going up. Can in theory reduce this as long as we apply other filters.
-Revaluate buy/sell criteria
-Pick highest profit, not just highest probability. Or combine both into some compount factor
